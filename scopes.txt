#1
Can add logic to spread load of the validators; as of now ,each validators is sent an request, whenever
 a new websites is added, this should not happen, as for n-websites, and m-validators, this operation will get
 pretty expenseive, and also there's no need of so many validaotrs, 
 SOLUTION- LOgic that limits max validators assigned to '10', for each webiste,


#2
 Adding RBAC, - 
 ROLES___________
 USER, the one who wants thier site to be validated,
 VALIDATOR, the one who validates the websites,
 ADMIN, the one who gets all info, in the dashboard. like total users, validators, website, success rates, etc etc.

#3 
A Page, whole different UI for the Validators, to join [Wanna Join Us ?] 
where, they can signup, login, addDetail, updateDetails, getDetails[walletBalance, publicKey, timestamps],
transactions(of withdrawals), add wallets, wesbites-monitored(history + present), 
** monitor new websites, we can add a page, of the currently "open-to-monitor websites" ,
where in the validators could come and select as in which websites they wanna monitor, listings may have,
